#summary Getting started with setting up Archiva

= Remote Repsository and Proxy =
Maven based project defaults to http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/ as Central Remote Repository.

The javasupport project itself defaults to a custom public available repository at http://faxintelligence.com:8082/archiva, which provided by courtesy of my employer.

This repository may be setup by yourself as internal Remote Repository(or sometimes called proxied). If you are to create your project, I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO SETUP YOUR OWN REMOTE REPOSITORY! EVEN IF YOU WERE TO HOST IT LOCALLY, IT'S STILL WORTH DOING! IT'S EASIER THAT YOU THINK.

Note that all project generated by javasupport's maven archetype will point to our repo as default. You would want to change this once you setup your own.

== Setup Your Own Internal Maven2 Repo ==
  # Install Archiva from http://maven.apache.org/archiva (use the standalone version Afthe first time, it's easier)
  # After you have Archiva running, open broswer to http://losthost:8080/archiva
  # Login as Admin user(default pass is admin) and change your default password.
  # From Menu goto Repositories and add two new Managed Repositories(make sure dir exists).
    # 1) A release repo points to /data/repositories/internal
    # 2) A snapshot repo points to /data/repositories/snapshots
  # Add Remote Repsitories in addition to what's already there:
    # 1) jobss: http://repository.jboss.org/maven2
    # 1) javanet: http://download.java.net/maven/2
  # From Menu goto Proxy Connectors, under internal create All the new repository you just added.
  # From Menu goto User Management, click on admin, then "Edit Role"
      # Select all check boxes and then Saven.

Now you have your internal repo ready. You may tell javasupport project to uses your repo in two ways:

method 1) 
Create a ${HOME}/.m2/settings.xml file that have the mirror elment
{{{
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<settings>
	<mirrors>
		<mirror>
		<id>central</id>
		<mirrorOf>central</mirrorOf>
		<url>http://losthost:8080/archiva/repository/internal</url>
		</mirror>
	</mirrors>

        <!-- this section is needed when you deploy into your own repo -->
        <servers>	
		<server>
			<id>localhost</id>
			<username>admin</username>
			<password>secretpass</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
</settings>
}}}
Assuming http://losthost:8080 is where you setup yoru Archiva.

NOTE: There is a sample at maven-support/bin/settings.xml.sample

method 2) 
Just edit javasupport/pom.xml and replace our repo url to your host and port version.


== Why Setup your Own Remote Repository ==
  * Well, for one thing you need to release your own project artifacts like jar or war files, this is where you upload to.
  * For a more reliable network download for dependencies.
  * For faster build!
